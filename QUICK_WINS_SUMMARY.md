# 🎉 Quick Wins Implementation - COMPLETED!

## ✅ What We've Built (2-3 hours of work)

### 1. 📊 Database Schema Updates ✓
**File:** `supabase-migrations-quick-wins.sql`

Added powerful new columns to the `issues` table:
- `priority` (low/medium/high) - Auto-calculated based on complaint count
- `complaint_count` - Tracks duplicate reports
- `sanctioned_amount` & `used_amount` - Financial tracking
- `amount_breakdown` (JSONB) - Detailed expense breakdown
- Date fields: `estimated_start_date`, `estimated_completion_date`, `actual_completion_date`
- `assigned_to`, `department`, `rejection_reason`, `progress_notes`

**New Table:** `progress_updates` for tracking issue lifecycle with RLS policies

**Instructions:** Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to add all new database features!
