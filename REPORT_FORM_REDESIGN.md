## üé§ Voice Recording Implementation

### Code Structure
```typescript
// State management
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const mediaRecorderRef = useRef<MediaRecorder | null>(null);

// Start recording
const startVoiceRecording = async () => {
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
  const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream);
  // ... recording logic
};

// Stop recording
const stopVoiceRecording = () => {
  if (mediaRecorderRef.current && isRecording) {
    mediaRecorderRef.current.stop();
  }
};

// Toggle function
const toggleVoiceRecording = () => {
  isRecording ? stopVoiceRecording() : startVoiceRecording();
};
```

### UI Component
```tsx
<div className="relative">
  <Textarea
    id="description"
    value={formData.description}
    onChange={...}
    className="pr-12"
  />
  <Button
    type="button"
    variant="ghost"
    size="sm"
    onClick={toggleVoiceRecording}
    className={`absolute right-2 top-2 ${isRecording ? 'text-red-600 animate-pulse' : 'text-slate-600'}`}
  >
    {isRecording ? <MicOff /> : <Mic />}
  </Button>
</div>
```
