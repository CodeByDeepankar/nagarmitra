## 🚀 Next Steps to Run

### 1. Set Up Supabase (5 minutes)

1. Create project at https://supabase.com
2. Copy URL and anon key
3. Create `.env.local` in `apps/citizen/`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
   ```
4. Run `supabase-setup.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
5. Create storage bucket `issue-images` (make it public)

### 2. Run the App

```bash
# From project root
npm run dev
```

Access at: **http://localhost:3001**

### 3. Test It Out

1. Sign up at `/auth/signup`
2. Sign in at `/auth/signin`
3. Report an issue at `/report`
4. View dashboard at `/dashboard`
5. Click issue for details
6. Add comments

## 📚 Documentation

Three comprehensive guides created:

1. **`QUICK_START.md`** - Fast setup instructions
2. **`CITIZEN_README.md`** - Complete documentation
3. **`supabase-setup.sql`** - Copy-paste database setup

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Clean, modern UI** with TailwindCSS
- **Mobile-responsive** layout
- **Status color coding**:
  - Yellow = Pending
  - Blue = In Progress  
  - Green = Resolved
- **Smooth transitions** and hover effects
- **Empty states** and loading indicators
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

## 🔧 Architecture Decisions

### Why Server Components?
- Better performance
- SEO friendly
- Direct database access
- No API routes needed

### Why Client Components?
- Forms need state
- Interactive features
- Real-time updates

### Why Supabase?
- Built-in auth
- Real-time capabilities
- Easy file storage
- Row-level security

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Some errors about `@repo/lib` are normal until you run the app - the workspace linking resolves at runtime

2. **CSS Warnings**: Tailwind `@tailwind` warnings are expected before running - they work fine in the app

3. **Environment Variables**: The app won't work without Supabase credentials in `.env.local`

4. **Storage Bucket**: Must be created manually in Supabase dashboard
